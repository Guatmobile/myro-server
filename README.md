myro-server
===========
Server to communicate between Android app and Google App engine server. Used Google Cloud Messaging to do the communcation. 
Also, the server receives get requests from Wojtek's python program for which our program generates a sequence of 
0s and 1s and renders that on the webpage. Wojtek receives this and verifies when Jason's app enters the code whether 
it is correct or not.
